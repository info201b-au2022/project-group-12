# Problem Domain
## I. Topic & Sociotechnical Setting
In this project, we decided to tackle the topic of voting and democracy, particularly in a dense urban area such as Seattle. Our group is interested in investigating the rates of voter turnout throughout different demographics, including but not limited to: socioeconomic status, ethnicity, location, and education level. In the era of technological connectivity, participating in our nation’s democracy should be as seamless and equitable as possible. However, barriers still exist that prevent certain groups of people from having a civic voice.

Theodore Johnson of the Brennan Center For Justice gives one example of many:
> “...the Brennan Center has documented a surge in voter purges — the sometimes error-prone process by which election officials remove allegedly ineligible voters from the rolls — in jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination in voting”
[(Johnson 2020)](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/new-voter-suppression)

## II. Values Addressed
One of the core values we aim to investigate (aside from the obvious value of democracy) is equity. Providing all members of a community with an equal opportunity to voice their opinions is a cornerstone of a society that values all walks of life and their needs.Collecting data around the subject of voting can lead to valuable conclusions about the areas where the law may lack in terms of protecting civil rights. Another key value of this problem domain is justice. Justice and equity are closely intertwined; addressing questions of equity in our democracy can then open doors for justice. For example, last year the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) and the Latino Community Fund of Washington opened legal cases against Benton, Chelan, and Yakima counties on the subject of voter suppression. The lawsuits challenge the current ballot system and rise in defense of Latino voters:
> “‘This is definitely a tool of voter suppression,’ says [voting and human rights attorney] Matter… ‘It seems the more politically engaged and civically engaged Latino voters are, the more discriminatory measures are being used’”
[(Hernandez 2021)](https://www.nbcrightnow.com/news/3-washington-state-counties-facing-a-lawsuit-for-latino-voter-suppression/article_4f4e6cda-bcf8-11eb-817a-43e11f752665.html)

## IV. Potential Harms & Benefits
A potential benefit of investigating democratic disparities would be the ability to increase voting accessibility for social groups that are currently underrepresented.
> “Turnout in states with all-mail balloting has been among the nation’s highest, and is often seen as a key to attracting voters who may not otherwise cast ballots because of the challenges of work, child care or transportation”
[(Baker 2022)](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/02/us/mail-voting-black-latino.html)
Bringing awareness to the issues faced by underrepresented communities would prevent further voter suppression and underrepresentation of said communities in the legal system and the government.
