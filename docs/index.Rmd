## What is this file for?

* This file will eventually become your project report for **P02: Exploratory Data Analysis**. Specifically, you will write rmarkdown to report your exploratory data analysis.

* Please see Canvas for more details.

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/data_access.R")
data_access_test()
```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
msg <- data_access_test(" Morgan!")
```

> `r msg` Hope you have a good day!! 

## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r echo=FALSE}
source("../source/summary_info.R")
```

## Dynamic Paragraph
The average percentage of white voters in the 2018 election across the United States was `r summary_info$avg_white_pct`%.
The average percentage of nonwhite voters in the 2018 election across the United States was `r summary_info$avg_nonwhite_pct`%.
The state with the highest average median household income of voters in the 2018 election was `r summary_info$max_hh_inc`.
The average percentage of female voters in the 2018 election across the United States was `r summary_info$avg_female_pct`%.
The state with the highest average percentage of voters that were aged 29 and under in the 2018 election was `r summary_info$max_young`.


```{r echo=FALSE}
source("../source/p2_map.R")
```

## Map
```{r echo=FALSE}
complete_map
```

## Purpose
We included this chart because we noticed that in the dataset, the type of ballot
box was split into two categories: drop boxes and voting centers. Because of this,
we thought it would be interesting to see what the distribution of drop boxes and
voting centers across Washington state were like to see if any obvious patterns arise,
like whether location affects the type of ballot box is near someone.

## Observations
After creating this map, something that can be seen quickly is the high number of
data points near Seattle. Specifically, these data points are blue which represent 
drop boxes. We can learn from this chart that more drop boxes are put in more densely
populated areas. However, that means that areas with less people have less options
for where they can return their ballots. This can make it harder for these populations
to vote and unfairly affect voting rates. Something else we can learn from this map
is that there's almost one voting center in each county. However, some counties are
larger than others which means that if someone in a larger county is interested in
voting in person, they have to go a further distance than a smaller county. This can
also limit voting rates in these populations.
