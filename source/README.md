# The `/source` Directory

All of our project code is found in this directory.  We further organize our code into 
these sub-directories (TODO: Update/Delete)

|Source Directories | Brief Description|
|---------------| -----------------|
|[Map](./p2_map.R) | This file contains the code to create a map from the Voting Locations and Ballot Boxes dataset. 
|[Summary_Info](./summary_info.R) | This file contains the code to 5 different values from the 2018 election dataset that will be included in the dynamic paragraph.
